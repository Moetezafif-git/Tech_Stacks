# 🚀 Vault CSI Provider

The **Vault CSI Provider** integrates HashiCorp Vault with Kubernetes, allowing you to securely inject secrets directly into your pods using Kubernetes' Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver. Say goodbye to manual secret management and hello to automated, dynamic, and secure secret injection.

## 🔐 Key Features

- **Dynamic Secrets Injection**: Secrets from Vault are automatically fetched and mounted as volumes inside your pods.
- **Enhanced Security**: Secrets are no longer hardcoded in your configurations. Instead, they’re securely managed and injected at runtime, reducing risk.
- **Multi-Engine Support**: Works with various Vault secret engines (Key/Value, Databases, PKI, etc.), giving you flexibility in how you manage your secrets.
- **Automatic Rotation**: Secrets are automatically renewed and rotated, ensuring they are always up-to-date without manual intervention.
- **Seamless Integration**: Compatible with existing Kubernetes workflows, providing a transparent and scalable way to manage sensitive data.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Vault Configuration**: Configure HashiCorp Vault with the secrets you need.
2. **CSI Driver**: Use the Vault CSI driver to mount secrets into your pods as volumes.
3. **Secure Delivery**: Vault securely delivers secrets to your applications without exposing them to the configuration files or code.
